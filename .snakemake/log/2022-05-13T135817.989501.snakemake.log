MissingOutputException in line 41 of C:\Users\tpavo\Documents\GitHub\Test_snf\Test_SNF_snake:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
C:/Users/tpavo/Desktop/Prova/results/tcga_aml/OS/randomForest/0/rSNF/INF_gene_meth_mirna_tr_1_1.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
